<h1>
    About Me
</h1>
<p>I am a dedicated and motivated individual with a strong foundation in technology and hands-on industry experience. I completed my B.Sc. in Computer Science in 2022 from Maharashtra College, where I developed a solid understanding of core programming concepts, problem-solving, and software fundamentals.

From May 2023 to December 2025, I worked at Hindustan Unilever as a Marketing Executive, gaining valuable experience in communication, strategy, analytics, and cross-functional teamwork. This role strengthened my ability to understand user needs, collaborate effectively, and manage projects efficiently.

During this journey, I discovered my passion for creating digital solutions and building impactful user experiences. I am now actively seeking an opportunity as a Full-Stack Web Developer, with a strong focus on learning, growing, and contributing to meaningful projects.

I’m committed, curious, and always eager to improve my technical skills while bringing my unique blend of marketing insight and tech knowledge to my development work.</p>
